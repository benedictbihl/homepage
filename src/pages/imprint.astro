        OpenAI Data Processing Addendum
      </h2>This Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) governs OpenAI’s processing of
      Customer Data provided by Customer to OpenAI through OpenAI’s API or any
      OpenAI services for businesses (“Services”) under the terms of the OpenAI
      Terms of Use, Enterprise Agreement, or other agreement between Customer
      and OpenAI governing Customer’s use of the Services (the “Agreement”) and
      is hereby incorporated into the Agreement. If and to the extent language
      in this DPA conflicts with the Agreement, the conflicting terms in this
      DPA shall control. Capitalized terms not defined in this DPA have the
      meaning set forth in the Agreement. For purposes of this DPA only,
      “Customer” includes any affiliate entity of Customer’s that (a) has
      entered into an Order Form with OpenAI and that (b) directly or
      indirectly, through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by,
      or is under common control with Customer. OpenAI and Customer each agree
      to comply with their respective obligations under applicable data privacy
      and data protection laws (collectively, “Data Protection Laws”) in
      connection with the Services. Data Protection Laws may include, depending
      on the circumstances, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 et seq., as amended by
      the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the California Consumer Privacy
      Act) (“CCPA”), Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 6-1-1301 et seq. (the Colorado Privacy
      Act) (“CPA”), Connecticut’s Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”), Utah Code Ann. §§
      13-61-101 et seq. (the Utah Consumer Privacy Act) (“UCPA”), VA Code Ann.
      §§ 59.1-575 et seq. (the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act) (“VCDPA”)
      (collectively “U.S. Privacy Laws”), and the European Union General Data
      Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”), and applicable
      subordinate legislation and regulations implementing those laws. In
      connection with the Agreement, Customer is the person that determines the
      purposes and means for which Customer Data (as defined below) is processed
      (a “Data Controller”), whereas OpenAI processes Customer Data in
      accordance with the Data Controller’s instructions and on behalf of the
      Data Controller (as a “Data Processor”). “Data Controller” and “Data
      Processor” also mean the equivalent concepts under Data Protection Laws.
      For purposes of the Agreement and this DPA, (i) “Personal Data” has the
      meaning assigned to the term “personal data” or “personal information”
      under applicable Data Protection Laws; and (ii)“Customer Data” means
      Personal Data that Customer provides to OpenAI that OpenAI processes on
      behalf of Customer to provide the Services. OpenAI will process Customer
      Data as Customer’s Data Processor to provide or maintain the Services and
      for the purposes set forth in this DPA, the Agreement and/or in any other
      applicable agreements between Customer and OpenAI. 1.Processing
      Requirements. As a Data Processor, OpenAI agrees to:a.process Customer
      Data only (i) on Customer’s behalf for the purpose of providing and
      supporting OpenAI’s Services (including to provide insights, reporting,
      analytics and platform abuse, trust and safety monitoring);; (ii) in
      compliance with the written instructions received from Customer; and (iii)
      in a manner that provides no less than the level of privacy protection
      required by Data Protection Laws; b.promptly inform Customer in writing if
      OpenAI cannot comply with the requirements of this DPA;c.not provide
      Customer with remuneration in exchange for Customer Data from Customer.
      The parties acknowledge and agree that Customer has not “sold” (as such
      term is defined by the CCPA) Customer Data to OpenAI;d.not “sell” (as such
      term is defined by U.S. Privacy Laws) or “share” (as such term is defined
      by the CCPA) Personal Data;e.inform Customer promptly if, in OpenAI’s
      opinion, an instruction from Customer violates applicable Data Protection
      Laws;f.require (i) persons employed by it and (ii) other persons engaged
      toperform on OpenAI’s behalf to be subject to a duty of confidentiality
      with respect to the Customer Data and to comply with the data protection
      obligations applicable to OpenAI under the Agreement and this DPA;g.engage
      the organizations or persons listed
      athttps://platform.openai.com/subprocessors to process Customer Data (each
      a “Subprocessor,” and the list at the foregoing URL, the “Subprocessor
      List”) to help OpenAI satisfy its obligations in accordance with this DPA
      or to delegate all or part of the processing activities to such
      Subprocessors. Customer hereby consents to the use of such Subprocessors.
      If Customer subscribes to email notifications as provided on the
      Subprocessor List 2website, then OpenAI will notify Customer of any
      changes OpenAI intends to make to the Subprocessor List at least 15 days
      before the changes take effect (which may be via email, a posting, or
      notification on an online portal for our services or other reasonable
      means).In the event that Customer does not wish to consent to the use of
      such additional Subprocessor, Customer may notify OpenAI that Customer
      does not consent within fifteen (15) days on reasonable grounds relating
      to the protection of Customer Data by following the instructions set forth
      in the Subprocessor List or contacting privacy@openai.com. In such case,
      OpenAI shall have the right to cure the objection through one of the
      following options: (i) OpenAI will cancel its plans to use the
      Subprocessor with regards to processing Customer Data or will offer an
      alternative to provide its Services or services without such Subprocessor;
      (ii) OpenAI will take the corrective steps requested by Customer in
      Customer objection notice and proceed to use the Subprocessor; (iii)
      OpenAI may cease to provide, or Customer may agree not to use whether
      temporarily or permanently, the particular aspect or feature of the OpenAI
      Services or services that would involve the use of such Subprocessor; or
      (iv) Customer may cease providing Customer Data to OpenAI for processing
      involving suchSubprocessor. If none of the above options are commercially
      feasible, in OpenAI’s reasonable judgment, and the objection(s) have not
      been resolved to the satisfaction of the parties within thirty (30) days
      of OpenAI’s receipt of Customer’sobjection notice, then either party may
      terminate any subscriptions, order forms or usage regarding the Services
      that cannot be providedwithout the use of the new Subprocessorfor cause
      and in such case, Customer will be refunded any pre-paid fees for the
      applicable subscriptions, order forms or usage to the extent they cover
      periods or terms following the date of such termination. Such termination
      right is Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy if Customer objects to any
      new Subprocessor. OpenAI shall enter into contractual arrangements with
      each Subprocessor binding them to provide a comparablelevel of data
      protection and information security to that provided for herein. Subject
      to the limitations of liability included in the Agreement, OpenAI agrees
      to be liable for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors to the same
      extent OpenAI would be liable under the terms of the DPA if it performed
      such acts or omissions itself; h.upon reasonable request no more than once
      peryear, provide Customer with OpenAI’s privacy and security policies and
      other such information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
      obligations set forth in this DPA and applicable Data Protection
      Laws;i.where required by law and upon reasonable notice and appropriate
      confidentiality agreements, cooperate with assessments, audits, or other
      steps performed by or on behalf of Customer at Customer’s sole expense and
      in a manner that is minimally disruptive to OpenAI’s business that are
      necessary to confirm that OpenAI is processing Customer Data in a manner
      consistent with this DPA. Where permitted by law, OpenAI may instead make
      available to customer a summary of the results of a third-party audit or
      certification reports relevant to OpenAI’s compliance with this DPA. Such
      results, and/or the results ofany such assessments, audits, or other steps
      shall be the Confidential Information of OpenAI;j.to the extent that
      Customer permits or instructs OpenAI to process Customer Data subject to
      U.S. Privacy Laws in a deidentified, anonymized, and/or aggregated form as
      part of the Services, OpenAI, OpenAI shall (i) adopt reasonable measures
      to prevent such deidentified data from being used to infer information
      about, or otherwise being linked to, a particular natural person or
      household; (ii) not attempt to reidentify the information, except that
      OpenAI may attempt to reidentify the information solely for the purpose of
      determining whether its deidentification processes comply with Data
      Protection Laws or are functioning as intended; and (iii) before sharing
      deidentified data with any other party, including Subprocessors,
      contractually obligate any such recipients to comply with the requirements
      of this provision;k.where the Customer Data is subject to the CCPA, not
      (i) retain, use, disclose, or otherwise process Customer Data except as
      necessary for the business purposes specified in the Agreement or this
      DPA; (ii) retain, use, disclose, or otherwise process Customer Data in any
      manner outside of the direct business relationship between OpenAI and
      Customer; or (iii) combine any Customer Data with Personal Data that
      OpenAI receives from or on behalf of any other third party or collects
      from OpenAI’s own interactions with individuals, provided that OpenAI may
      so combine Customer Data for a purpose permitted under the CCPA if
      directed to do so by Customer or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA;
      3l.where required by law, grant Customerthe rights to (i) take reasonable
      and appropriate steps to ensure that OpenAI uses Customer Data in a manner
      consistent with Data Protection Laws by exercising the audit provisions
      set forth in this DPA above; and (ii) stop and remediate unauthorized use
      of Customer Data, for example by requesting that OpenAI provide written
      confirmation that applicable Customer Data has been deleted.2.Notice to
      Customer. OpenAI will inform Customer if OpenAI becomes aware of:a.any
      legally binding request for disclosure of Customer Data by a law
      enforcement authority, unless OpenAI is otherwise forbidden by law to
      inform Customer, for example to preserve the confidentiality of an
      investigation by law enforcement authorities;b.any notice, inquiry or
      investigation by an independent public authority established by a member
      state pursuant to Article 51 of the GDPR (a “Supervisory Authority”) with
      respect to Customer Data; orc.any complaint or request (in particular,
      requests for access to, rectification or blocking of Customer Data)
      received directly from Customer’s data subjects. OpenAI will not respond
      to any such request without Customer’s prior written
      authorization.3.Assistance to Customer. OpenAI will provide reasonable
      assistance to Customer regarding:a.information necessary, taking into
      account the nature of the processing, to respond torequests received
      pursuant to Data Protection Lawsfrom Customer’s data subjects in respect
      of access to or the rectification, erasure, restriction, portability,
      objection, blocking or deletion of Customer Data that OpenAI processes for
      Customer. In the event that a data subject sends such a request directly
      to OpenAI, OpenAI will promptly send such request to Customer;b.the
      investigation of any breach of OpenAI’s security leading to the accidental
      or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or
      unauthorized access to Customer Data processed by OpenAI for Customer (a
      “Personal Data Breach”); andc.where appropriate, the preparation of data
      protection impact assessments with respect to the processing of Customer
      Data by OpenAI and, where necessary, carrying out consultationswith any
      supervisory authority with jurisdiction over such processing.4.Required
      Processing. If OpenAI is required by Data Protection Laws to process any
      Customer Data for a reason other than in connection with the Agreement,
      OpenAI will inform Customer of this requirement in advance of any such
      processing, unless legally prohibited.5.Security. OpenAI will:a.maintain
      reasonable and appropriate organizational and technical security measures
      (including with respect to personnel, facilities, hardware and software,
      storage and networks, access controls, monitoring and logging,
      vulnerability and breach detection, incident response, and encryption) to
      protect against unauthorized or accidental access, loss, alteration,
      disclosure or destruction of Customer Data and to protect the rights of
      the subjects of that Customer Data;b.take appropriate steps to confirm
      that OpenAI personnel are protecting the security, privacy and
      confidentiality of Customer Data consistent with the requirements of this
      DPA; andc.notify Customer of any Personal Data Breach by OpenAI, its
      Subprocessors, or any other third parties acting on OpenAI’s behalf
      without undue delay after OpenAI becomes aware of such Personal Data
      Breach.6.Obligations of Customer.a.Customer represents, warrants and
      covenants that it has and shall maintain throughout the term all necessary
      rights, consents and authorizations to provide the Customer Data to OpenAI
      and to authorize OpenAI to use, disclose, retain and otherwise process
      Customer Data as contemplated by this DPA, the Agreement and/or other
      processing instructions provided to OpenAI.b.Customer shall comply with
      all applicable Data Protection Laws.c.Customer shall reasonably cooperate
      with OpenAI to assist OpenAI in performing any of its obligations with
      regard to any requests from Customer’s data subjects.d.Without prejudice
      to OpenAI’s security obligations in Section 5 of this DPA, Customer
      acknowledges and agrees that it, rather than OpenAI, is responsible for
      certain configurations and design decisions for theservices and that
      Customer, and not OpenAI, is responsible for implementing those
      4configurations and design decisions in a secure manner that complies with
      applicable Data Protection Laws. e.Customer shall not provide Customer
      Data to OpenAI except through agreed mechanisms. For example, Customer
      shall not include Customer Data other than technical contact information,
      or in technical support tickets, transmit user Customer Data to OpenAI by
      email. Without limitation to the foregoing, Customer represents,warrants
      and covenants that it shall only transfer Customer Data to OpenAI using
      secure, reasonable and appropriate mechanisms, to the extent such
      mechanisms are within Customer’s control.f.Customer shall not take any
      action that would (i) render the provision of Customer Data to OpenAI a
      “sale” under U.S. Privacy Laws or a “share” under the CCPA (or equivalent
      concepts under U.S. Privacy Laws); or (ii) render OpenAI not a “service
      provider” under the CCPA or “processor” under U.S. Privacy Laws.7.Standard
      Contractual Clauses. a.OpenAI will process Customer Data that originates
      in the European Economic Area in accordance with the standard contractual
      clauses adopted by the EU Commission on June 4, 2021 (“EU SCCs”) which are
      deemed entered into (and incorporated into this DPA by this reference) and
      completed as follows: i.Module Two (Controller to Processor) of the EU
      SCCs apply when Customer is a controller and OpenAI is processing Customer
      Data as a processor.ii.Module Three (Processor to Sub-Processor) of the EU
      SCCs apply when Customer is a processor and OpenAI is processing Customer
      Data as a sub-processor.b.For each module of the EU SCCs, where
      applicable, the following applies: i.The optional docking clause in Clause
      7 does not apply;ii.In Clause 9, Option 2 (general written authorization)
      applies, and the minimum time period for prior notice of sub-processor
      changes shall be as set forth in Section 1(g) of this DPA.iii.In Clause
      11, the optional language does not apply; iv.All square brackets in Clause
      13 are hereby removed; v.In Clause 17 (Option 1), the EU SCCs will be
      governed by the EU member state where the data exporter is located; vi.In
      Clause 18(b), disputes will be resolved before the courts of the EU member
      state where the data exporter is located; vii.Exhibit Ato this DPA
      contains the information required in Annex I and Annex III of the EU SCCs;
      viii.Exhibit Bto this DPA contains the information required in Annex II of
      the EU SCCs; and c.Customer Data originating from Switzerland shall be
      processed in accordance with the EU SCCs with the following amendments:
      i.“FDPIC” means the Swiss Federal Data Protection andInformation
      Commissioner.ii.“Revised FADP” means the revised version of the FADP of 25
      September 2020, which is scheduled to come into force on 1 January
      2023.iii.The term “EU Member State” must not be interpreted in such a way
      as to exclude data subjects in Switzerland from the possibility for suing
      their rights in their place of habitual residence (Switzerland) in
      accordance with Clause 18(c).iv.The EU SCCs also protect the data of legal
      entities until the entry into force of the Revised FADP.v.The FDPIC shall
      act as the “competent supervisory authority” insofar as the relevant data
      transfer is governed by the FADPd.With respect to Customer Data
      originating from the United Kingdom, the parties will comply with the
      terms of Part 2: Mandatory Clauses of the ApprovedAddendum, being the
      template Addendum B.1.0 issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office
      and laid before Parliament in accordance with s119A of the Data Protection
      Act 2018 on 2 February 2022, as it is revised under Section 18 of those
      Mandatory Clauses (the “UK Addendum”). The parties also agree (i) that the
      information included in Part 1 of the UK Addendum is as set out in Annex I
      of Appendix A to this 5DPA and (ii) that either party may end the UK
      Addendum as set out in Section 19 of the UK Addendum.8.Term; Data Return
      and Deletion. This DPA shall remain in effect as long as OpenAI carries
      out Customer Data processing operations on Customer’s behalf or until the
      termination of the Agreement (and all Customer Data has been returned or
      deleted in accordance with this DPA). OpenAI will retain Customer Data
      sent through the API for a maximum of thirty (30) days, after which it
      will be deleted, except where OpenAI is required to retain copies under
      applicable laws, in which case OpenAI will isolate and protect that
      Customer Data from any further processing except to the extent required by
      applicable laws. On the termination of the DPA, OpenAI will direct each
      Subprocessor to delete the Customer Data within thirty (30) days of the
      DPA’s termination, unless prohibited by law. For clarity, OpenAI may
      continue to process information derived from Customer Data that has been
      deidentified, anonymized, and/or aggregated such that the data is no
      longer considered Personal Data under applicable Data Protection Laws
      andin a manner that does not identify individuals or Customer to improve
      OpenAI’s systems and services.
